# Predictive Modeling for Security Risk Management in Humanitarian Organizations

## Introduction

In the field of humanitarian assistance, security incidents pose significant threats to both aid workers and the vulnerable communities they serve. This project leverages historical incident data spanning from 1997 to 2024 ([Data](https://www.aidworkersecurity.org/incidents/search)) to build predictive models that help anticipate high-risk events. Our analysis, carried out in Jupyter Notebooks, focuses on key metrics such as casualties and fatalities across various humanitarian organizations (e.g., UN, INGO, ICRC, NRCS and IFRC, NNGO and Others). By uncovering temporal, spatial, and contextual patterns, I aim to provide actionable insights that can inform the deployment of resources and targeted security measuresâ€”ultimately contributing to saving lives.

## Problem Statement

Humanitarian organizations operate in some of the world's most volatile and dangerous environments. Despite international efforts to protect aid workers, a substantial number of incidents result in significant casualties and fatalities. The current reactive approach often leaves these organizations struggling to prioritize resources and adapt to rapidly changing security conditions. There is a critical need for a data-driven, predictive framework that not only assesses current risk levels but also forecasts future incidents based on historical trends, geographic data, and operational contexts. Such insights would empower organizations to proactively implement tailored security measures, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall crisis response.

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Clean the dataset to address missing values, correct data types, and remove redundant columns.Conduct comprehensive EDA to understand distributions, identify outliers, and uncover correlations among key variables

- **Data Exploration and Feature Engineering:**  
  Analyze incident data from 1997 to 2024 to understand the underlying patterns and trends in casualties, fatalities, and other key metrics. Engineer meaningful features (temporal, spatial, and categorical) that capture the nuances of security risks.

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Develop and validate classification models that generate predicted probabilities of high-risk incidents. The models will incorporate factors such as location, time of year, historical incident patterns, motives, and attack contexts.

- **Risk Assessment and Decision Support:**  
  Translate model outputs into actionable risk scores that inform decision-making for humanitarian organizations. This will guide them in adopting appropriate security measures and strategic interventions to mitigate the impact of potential incidents.

- **Operational Integration:**  
  Ensure that the predictive insights are both interpretable and robust, facilitating seamless integration into the operational frameworks of humanitarian agencies. The ultimate goal is to help these organizations enhance the safety of their personnel while continuing to deliver vital aid to communities in need.
